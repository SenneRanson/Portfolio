### Internship

- Company: Belfius Bank & Verzekeringen
- Description: During my internship, I delved into the daily operations of a Db2v12 for z/OS database administrator. One of the tasks of a database administrator is monitoring and performance tuning of Db2v12 for z/OS databases. Additionally, scripting with JCL, REXX, Python was involved, and I explored working with Db2 for z/OS REST services. I developed a simple UI to quickly retrieve information about a specific database (e.g., How many columns does table x contain? Is table y partitioned? If so, how many members does it contain?) Lastly, I also gained insight into the workings of Microsoft Azure data-related products within the team, such as Azure SQL database and Azure Synapse Analytics.
